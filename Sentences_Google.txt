1. In January 2017, Google announced work on a Python 2.7 to Go transcompiler.
2. The Register speculated that this was in response to Python 2.7's planned end-of-life , but Google cited performance under concurrent workloads as their only motivation.
3. Other just-in-time Python compilers have been developed, but are now unsupported: Google began a project named Unladen Swallow in 2009 with the aim of speeding up the Python interpreter fivefold by using the LLVM, and of improving its multithreading ability to scale to thousands of cores.
4. Google's Grumpy compiles Python to Go.
5. Large organizations that use Python include Wikipedia, Google, Yahoo! , CERN, NASA, and some smaller entities like ILM and ITA.
6. It has also been used in several video games,  and has been adopted as first of the three available programming languages in Google App Engine, the other two being Java and Go.
